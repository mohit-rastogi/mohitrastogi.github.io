The goal of my research work is focused on a multi-omics data-driven systems biology approach to identify molecular targets both at transcriptome and proteome level to rescue Down syndrome (DS)-associated cognitive impairment using both mouse models and human DS brains. I am also interested in identifying the role of different cell types in Down syndrome and their mode of action using iPSCs.\n            \n            \n              I am a PhD student in the lab of Laura Cancedda in the Department of Neuroscience at Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), Genoa, Italy.
